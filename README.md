# domain
The Domain is the core of the service, it sholudnÂ´t change at least the bussiness logic changes.

# entities
The Entities are classes that represent the bussiness's objects and their rules. An instanced Entity cloud be the representation of a record in the DB or not.

# valueObjects
Value Objects are classes used to represent data in a more complex way than a primitive value for example: And address could be a string but if we want attach validation logic and work with the parts of the address we need something more than a string and use a class to represent the addrress.

# domainErrors
The Domain Errors are classes responibles for map the errors that could occur in the domain, these errors ar not exceptions but bussiness logic related errors.
